A Python implementation of the Disk Paxos consensus algorithm tailored for the Maelstrom testbench. This project simulates a shared-disk environment by leveraging Maelstrom's linearizable key-value store (lin-kv) as the common storage medium. It demonstrates how processes can reach consensus by reading and writing to dedicated disk blocks, ensuring safety and liveness even in the presence of node failures and network partitions.
